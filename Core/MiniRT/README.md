# miniRT

This project is a simple ray tracer that can render 3D scenes with basic shapes and lighting. The program reads a scene description from a file and generates an image of the scene using ray tracing techniques.

The program uses the `minilibx` library to create the window and display the rendered image.

note: scene is rendered by the cpu, not the gpu

## Usage

```shell
make
./miniRT <scene.rt>
```
